# Shulker Boxed Mass Crafting
 Mass Craft Fully Filled Shulker Boxes
 
 This is a quality of life datapack for technical players with to high demands

# What does this datapack do?

You can use fully filled (27 * 64 items) shulker boxes directly in the crafting table, and get a shulker box filled with the desired item

## Example

- putting a shulker box of redstone above a shulker box of sticks will craft into a shulker box of redstone torches, and will leave one shulker box behind in the crafting grid (similar to crafting a cake)

## Installation

# Known Issues

- Some recipes consume more than one shulker box (ex. anvil)
    - _this is due to a limitation of the NBT Crafting mod_
- Only works with default shulker boxes
    - _some more common recipes **(such as repeaters or comparators)** also work with White Shulker Boxes_
- Recipes that use tags (ex. #minecraft:planks) are not working (exception: piston)
