 This is a quality of life datapack for technical players with to high demands

# What does this datapack do?

You can use fully filled (27 * 64 items) shulker boxes directly in the crafting table, and get a shulker box filled with the desired item

## Example

- putting a shulker box of redstone above a shulker box of sticks will craft into a shulker box of redstone torches, and will leave one shulker box behind in the crafting grid (similar to crafting a cake)


# How to use

## Requirements
- Latest release of [NBT Crafting](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nbt-crafting) by [Siphalor](https://github.com/Siphalor/)
- Latest release of [this datapack](https://github.com/Tom3s/shulkerboxed-masscrafting/releases)

## Installation
- I assume you know how to install mods, sooo....
- step 2: copy the `Shulker.Boxed.Mass.Craft.zip` into you world's datapack folder

OR

- step 2: apply the datapack upon world generation


# Known Issues

- Some recipes consume more than one shulker box (ex. anvil)
    - _this is due to a limitation of the NBT Crafting mod_
- Only works with default shulker boxes
    - _some more common recipes **(such as repeaters or comparators)** also work with White Shulker Boxes_
- Recipes that use tags (ex. #minecraft:planks) are not working (exception: piston)
